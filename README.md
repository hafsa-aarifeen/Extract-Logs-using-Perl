# Extract-Logs-using-Perl   

This script extracts lines from a log file based on specific criteria defined in an INI configuration file. It utilizes the _Config::IniFiles_ module to read the configuration and search for patterns within the log file.   
Extracted lines are then saved to a separate output file
